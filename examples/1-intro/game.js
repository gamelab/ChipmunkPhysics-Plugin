	// The first step is to create a space object. 
	// Space is where all the simulation happens.

	// cp.v is a quick way to create new Chipmunk Vector Objects.
	// Vector Objects are used for all x/y based values. (positions, velocity, e.t.c)

	// Bodies in chipmunk contain all positional/rotational data for shapes. 
	
	// If you want the body to be affected by gravity (and other space things), then you will need to add the body to that space. (as stated above) 
	// This can be done through the 'addBody' method, on the space you want to add it too.
	
	// Otherwise you can leave them not added. When not added they are called 'rogue' bodies, because they are not simulated.

	// A 'layer' is a pane in space, upon which collisions with other shapes will happen.
	// Shapes on the same layer will collide with one another, but not with shapes assigned to a different layer.
	// By default shapes do not have a layer, and because of that all shapes will collide with each other.
	
	// Example: If you have two shapes, A and B (ignore the type for this example) and they are coming at each other. By default they will meet eventually and collide. 
	// Now if you assign Shape A to a layer, the same result as above will happen. This is because shape B doesn't have an assigned layer and thus it will collide with objects on ALL other layers.
	// But if you assigned Shape B to a DIFFERENT layer, then they wouldn't collide. Because they result there collisions in different layers.
